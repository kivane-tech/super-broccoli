# Backend Development Project for Candidate Evaluation

This project aims to assess your backend development skills and your ability to design and implement server-side logic and APIs. You are free to choose any backend language/framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, Ruby on Rails, Java/Spring) and database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) that you are most comfortable with. Please ensure your code is well-organized, readable, and demonstrates best practices.

**Submission Guidelines:**

* Please submit your project as a link to a public repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).
* Include clear instructions on how to run your application and any necessary setup in the README file.
* Specify the language, framework, and database used.
* Include API documentation (e.g., using Swagger/OpenAPI or a clear README section outlining endpoints, request/response formats).
* You have 3-5 days to complete and submit the project.

**Project Description: Simple Book API**

You will be building a basic RESTful API for managing a collection of books. The API should allow for the following operations:

**Core Features:**

* **Create a Book:**
    * Accept data (e.g., title, author, publication year, ISBN) to create a new book record.
    * Return a success status and the details of the newly created book.
* **Read a Single Book:**
    * Accept a unique identifier (e.g., ID, ISBN) to retrieve the details of a specific book.
    * Return the book details or an appropriate error if the book is not found.
* **Read All Books:**
    * Retrieve and return a list of all books in the collection.
* **Update a Book:**
    * Accept a unique identifier and updated data for a book.
    * Update the book record and return a success status with the updated book details.
* **Delete a Book:**
    * Accept a unique identifier to delete a specific book record.
    * Return a success status or an appropriate error if the book is not found.

**Enhancements (Optional for More Advanced Users):**

* **Data Validation:**
    * Implement robust validation for incoming data (e.g., ensuring required fields are present, data types are correct, ISBN format is valid).
    * Return informative error messages for invalid requests.
* **Pagination:**
    * Implement pagination for the "Read All Books" endpoint to handle a large number of books efficiently. Allow clients to specify page number and page size.
* **Filtering:**
    * Allow clients to filter the list of books based on specific criteria (e.g., by author, publication year).
* **Sorting:**
    * Enable clients to sort the list of books based on different fields (e.g., title, author, publication year).
* **Error Handling:**
    * Implement comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage potential issues (e.g., database errors, invalid input).
    * Return appropriate HTTP status codes and informative error messages.
* **Authentication/Authorization (Basic):**
    * Implement basic authentication (e.g., using API keys or HTTP Basic Auth) to protect the API endpoints.
    * *(Clearly document how to authenticate in the README.)*
* **Database Relationships (If applicable):**
    * If you choose to model more complex data, consider implementing relationships (e.g., associating books with genres or publishers).

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* **Functionality:** Does the API correctly implement the core and any chosen enhanced features?
* **Code Quality:** Is the code well-structured, readable, and maintainable? Are best practices followed?
* **API Design:** Is the API well-designed, RESTful, and easy to understand and use?
* **Data Handling:** Is data being handled securely and efficiently?
* **Error Handling:** Are errors handled gracefully and are informative responses provided?
* **Testing (Optional but Recommended):** Are there any tests (unit, integration) included to demonstrate the API's functionality?
* **Documentation:** Is the API well-documented?
* **Database Schema:** Is the database schema well-designed (if applicable)?
* **Problem-Solving:** How effectively did you approach and solve the challenges?
* **Commit History:** A clear and concise commit history is a plus.

We look forward to reviewing your submissions! Good luck!
